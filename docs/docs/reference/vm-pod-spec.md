# Defining a VM Pod

The basic idea of a VM pod is that it's a plain Kubernetes pod
definition with the following conditions satisfied:

1. It has `kubernetes.io/target-runtime: virtlet.cloud`
   [annotation](#cri-proxy-annotation) so it can be recognized by
   [CRI Proxy](https://github.com/Mirantis/criproxy).
2. The pod has exactly one container.
3. The container's image has `virtlet.cloud/` prefix followed by
   the image name which is recognized according to Virtlet's
   [image handling rules](../images/) and used to download
   the QCOW2 image for the VM.

If you have Virtlet running only on some of the nodes in the cluster,
you also need to specify either `nodeSelector` or `nodeAffinity` for
the pod to have it land on a node with Virtlet. If a VM pod lands on a
node which doesn't have Virtlet or where Virtlet and
[CRI Proxy](https://github.com/Mirantis/criproxy) aren't configured
properly, you can see the following messages in `kubectl describe`
output for the VM pod (the message can be printed as a single line):
```
Warning  Failed     5s (x2 over 17s)  kubelet, kubemaster
Failed to pull image "virtlet.cloud/cirros":
rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Error response from daemon:
Get https://virtlet.cloud/v2/: dial tcp 50.63.202.10:443:
connect: connection refused
```
This means that kubelet is trying to pull the VM image from a Docker
registry.

It's also possible to construct higher-level Kubernetes objects such
as Deployment, StatefulSet or DaemonSet out of VM pods, in which case
the `template` section of the object must follow the above rules for
VM pods.

Below is an example of a Virtlet pod. The comments describe the
particular parts of the pod spec. The following sections will give
more details on each part of the spec.

```

# Annotations recognized by Virtlet

The annotations can be specified under `annotations` key of the
`metadata` part of the pod spec. Note that the values are always
strings, but they can be parsed in different way by Virtlet (see Type
column).

For boolean keys, the string `"true"` (lowercase) is interpreted as a
true value. All other values are interpreted as false.

Several keys belong to the [Cloud-Init](../cloud-init/) settings which
are described in detail in the
[corresponding section](../cloud-init/).

## CRI Proxy annotation

Besides Virtlet annotations, there's `kubernetes.io/target-runtime:
virtlet.cloud` annotation which is handled by
[CRI Proxy](https://github.com/Mirantis/criproxy).  It's important to
specify it as well as `virtlet.cloud` prefix for CRI Proxy to be able
to direct requests to Virtlet.

## Chowning 9pfs mounts

Setting `VirtletChown9pfsMounts` to `true` causes
[9pfs mounts](#9pfs-mounts) to chown their volume contents to make
it readable and writable by the VM.

## CPU Model

`VirtletCPUModel: host-model` annotation enables nested
virtualization.  `VirtletLibvirtCPUSetting` is an expert-only
annotation that sets the CPU options for libvirt. The YAML keys
correspond to the XML elements and attributes in the
[libvirt XML definition](https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsCPU),
but are capitalized. The value of `Model` field goes into the `Value`
key. For example:

```yaml
Match: exact
Model:
  Fallback: allow
  Value: core2duo
```

## Disk driver

The driver is set using `VirtletDiskDriver` annotation which may have
the value of `scsi` (the default) or `virtio`.  Some OS images may
have problem with the default `scsi` driver, for example, CirrOS
can't handle [Cloud-Init](../cloud-init/) data unless `virtio` driver
is used.

## Injecting files into the image

By using `VirtletFilesFromDataSource` annotation, it's possible to
place the contents of a ConfigMap or a Secret on the image before
booting the VM. For more information, refer to
[Injecting files into the VM](../injecting-files/).

## vCPU count

Virtlet defaults to using just one vCPU per VM. You can change this
value by setting `VirtletVCPUCount` annotation to the desired value,
for example, `VirtletVCPUCount: "2"`.

# Volume handling

Virtlet can recognize and handle pod's `volumes` and container's
`volumeMounts` sections. This can also be used to make the VM use a
persistent root filesystem which will survive pod removal and
re-creation. For more information on working with volumes, please
refer to the [Volumes](../volumes/) section.

# Environment variables

Virtlet supports passing environment variables to the VM using the standard
`env` settings in the container definition:

```yaml
...
spec:
...
containers:
  - name: cirros-vm
    ...
    env:
    - name: MY_FOO_VAR
      value: foo
    - name: MY_FOOBAR_VAR
      value: foobar
```

Virtlet uses [Cloud-Init](../cloud-init/) mechanisms to write the
values into `/etc/cloud/environment` file inside the VM which
has the same `key=value` per line format as `/etc/environment`
and can be either read by an application or sourced by a shell:
```sh
MY_FOO_VAR=foo
MY_FOOBAR_VAR=foobar
```

For this environment mechanism to work, the cloud-init implementation
inside the VM must be able to handle `write_files` inside the
Cloud-Init user-data.
