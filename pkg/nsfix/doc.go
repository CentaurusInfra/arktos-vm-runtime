// Package nsfix helps to deal with switching to other process
// namespaces to execute some particular piece of code.  While
// starting from Go 1.10 it's possible to switch to different non-mnt
// namespaces without the danger of corrupting other goroutines'
// state, there's still a problem of not being able to switch to
// another mount namespace from a Go program without the "constructor"
// hack. For more info, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/25707007/40846
// https://github.com/golang/go/issues/8676
