# This is the iPXE boot script that we embed into the iPXE binary.
#
# The entire reason for the existence of this script is that iPXE very
# eagerly configures DHCP as soon as it gets a DHCP response, and
# because of this it might miss the ProxyDHCP response that tells it
# how to boot. In this situation, `autoboot` (the default command)
# just fails and falls out of the PXE boot codepath, so we end up with
# machines that sometimes fail to "catch" the network boot.
#
# This script implements what the ipxe documentation recommends, which
# is to just retry the `dhcp` command a bunch until ipxe does see a
# ProxyDHCP response. It's quite ugly, and a proper fix should really
# get upstreamed to ipxe, but for right now, this works.
